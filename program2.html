                <p>The only thing that stands in the way of lakhs of adolescent girls across Karnataka from completing

                    sending them to school because of inadequate toilet facilities.</p>

                <p>Bangalore-based Independent campaigner Archana KR is on a mission to change that by persuading the
                    Government and other stakeholders to provide clean and safe toilet facilities so that girls fulfil
                    their dreams of becoming school graduates.

                <p>She is looking to create a strategy that integrates media to bring about policy changes towards
                    toilets in educational institutions while providing qualitative and quantitative information towards
                    this urgently required change.

                <p>Manual Scavengingis one of the most dehumanizing practise plaguing Indian Society. A stubborn remnant

                <p>Two journalists are looking to spread information to curb the practise, through a multimedia campaign
                    with feature stories, photo essays, videos, and events, to end the life-threatening, inhumane and
                    casteist practice of manual cleaning of sewers in a targeted manner in Bengaluru.</p>
                <p> The campaign aims to eradicate the practice by having one robotic cleaner in each of the 198 civic
                    governance wards, while making every Bengalurean aware of the illegality, insensitivity of the
                    practice.</p>

                    sustainable and inclusive while providing a new paradigm for use of derelict urban lands in India.
                </p>
                <p>As a first project, Kaustubh Rau proposes metamorphosing the old factory site of Mysore Lamp Works
                    into an urban commons accessible to all of Bengaluru. He aims to convert derelict spaces into public
                    spaces while the citizen benefits from the environment and cultural elements that the space can
                    bring. Shifting the approach to overall urban development, architecture and policy change are

                <p>Through the memory mapping of senior citizens, the expansion of the repository of oral textile design
                    stories is used to skill youth and weavers in sustainable employment, and arrest distressed
                    rural-urban migration. As a part of the project, locally produced silk waste or up-cycled yarn is
                    used in recreating textiles rooted in Karnataka’s heritage. </p>
                <p>The Reimagining Handlooms in Karnataka wants to reach out to the villages to inspire the youth to
                    take up the old traditions of weaving. The repository of oral stories collected from the older
                    generation of weavers acts as an archive of knowledge influencing the future of traditional weaves

                <p>The streets of a city are its lifeline. All form of travel and commerce flow through them. Right of
                    the way therefore becomes the very spine of how the culture of a city evolves. However, the mobility
                    within the city functions far beyond the parameters of civility, where streets increasingly are
                    experienced as inhospitable places, especially for pedestrians and cyclists.</p>

                <p>The distorted usage of a commonly held good i.e. roads, as a conduit for vehicles with bias towards
                    the motor vehicle as having the right of the way on the city streets is rampant. The need to instil
                    a new mobility culture is crucial for the ever growing city. Equity on Streets is an initiative by
                    CiFoS to bring about a behaviour change in drivers of motor vehicles, while creating new approaches
                    to address the inequity in street life. </p>

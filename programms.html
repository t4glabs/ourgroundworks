                Aravani Art Project embraces the need to expand the possibilities and use of public spaces by the
                Transgender Community by creating consciousness and wellbeing through art, awareness and social
                participation. The aim of the project Ten-Foldis to have creative interventions in public spaces in 10
                Districts around Karnataka.

                <p>The project will work on transgender issues which need visibility, awareness and solidarity, through
                    art, to capture the hidden culture, stories, facts, mythology and arrive at a documentary that will
                    be used as an archive for culture and impact studies.
                </p>
                <p> The documentary will further help in the future of policymaking, healthcare, and other interventions
                    that are necessary for the wellbeing of the Transgender Community in Karnataka.</p>

                <p>The stories we tell shape our society. The story of a 50-year-old Vijayshree who started off as a
                    garment factory worker and became an entrepreneur, running a beauty parlour for the past 21 years in
                    Bangalore. Hers has been a remarkable story of grit and determination. However, stories like hers
                    seldom make the news.</p>

                <p>The project Her Storiesby Co-Media Lab, is aimed at making and distributing similar short videos
                    about the women who went against the grain and emerged as beacons of inspiration for their
                    community. </p>
                <p>The videos will in turn be made by women belonging to the marginalized communities, trained to tell
                    stories of their folk, increasing the media literacy within the community, while emancipating the
                    women further.</p>

                <p>The streets of a city are its lifeline. All form of travel and commerce flow through them. Right of
                    the way therefore becomes the very spine of how the culture of a city evolves. However, the mobility
                    within the city functions far beyond the parameters of civility, where streets increasingly are
                    experienced as inhospitable places, especially for pedestrians and cyclists.
                </p>

                <p>The distorted usage of a commonly held good i.e. roads, as a conduit for vehicles with bias towards
                    the motor vehicle as having the right of the way on the city streets is rampant. The need to instil
                    a new mobility culture is crucial for the ever growing city.</p>
                <p>Equity on Streetsis an initiative by CiFos to bring about a behaviour change in drivers of motor
                    vehicles, while creating new approaches to address the inequity in street life. </p>

                <p>It aims at giving accurate, practical and actionable legal information to the people about their
                    rights and responsibilities while interacting with the police and justice system. The campaign by
                    Nyaaya will function as a compendium of videos that will be accessible to all to learn their rights
                    during legal processes especially for situations such as complaints, arrests and applications for
                    bail.</p>
                <p>The campaign requires a creative strategist, ground-level support for research and funding to make
